## Work strategy
All times are used in Moscow TIMEZONE. For scrum the PST is added in brackets.

> - 9:00am - start
- 9:00am - 9:30am - each team member review the tasks/bugs/everything and prepare to scrum
- 9:30am (11:30pm) - 10:00am (12:00am) - scrum
- 10:00am - 11:00am - discussing questions, change plan for the day if needed and so on
- 11:00am - 6:00pm (end of the day) - working on tasks

The main idea is to do all preparing, reviewing, discussing work and scrum during the first 2 hours in the beginning of the day (it can be less than two hours actually). So the rest of the day is going to be very efficient. Each team member understands fully what is his goal for the day.

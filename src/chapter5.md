## Scrum strategy
The preferred way is video/voice conference. But the short summary should be pushed to #scrum channel in Slack.
The example is

**Yesterday:**
1. Task #N1, Task title, URL in Trello
2. Tech review of Task #N2, Task title, URL in Trello (activity type for TL only)
3. ...

**Today:**
1. Task #N1, Task title, URL in Trello
2. Tech review of Task #N2, Task title, URL in Trello (activity type for TL only)
3. ...

**Progress:** #N1 (35%), #N2 (20%), â€¦

**Questions:**
1. question 1 about some thing (link the user for who this question is)

_**Availability**: 10am - 9pm with random brakes / 10am - 1pm, then 4pm - 10pm or something like this (the SAME TIMEZONE should be used)_
